# National Canadian Youth Council
### Youth voices shaping youth rights

</div>

---

## Why this exists

In Canada, there are **nearly 4 million people between the ages of 10 and 19**.  
Almost **half don’t know they have rights**.

Not abstract human rights.  
Rights that are **specific to children and youth**, protected under the  
**United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)**.

That gap between rights on paper and rights in practice is where this council lives.

## What we are

The **National Canadian Youth Council** is a youth led national platform bringing together young founders, organizers, and social innovators from across Canada.

We exist to make sure youth are not just consulted symbolically, but meaningfully involved in shaping the policies and systems that affect their lives.

This is collaboration over competition.  
Lived experience over assumptions.  
Action over awareness alone.

---

## What we do

We create spaces where youth work together on real projects tied to youth rights.  
We host consultations that elevate youth voices into policy conversations.  
We support government action that strengthens the implementation of the UNCRC in Canada.

Our work connects ideas to impact and voices to decision makers.

## What makes this different

We don’t advocate *for* youth.

We are youth.

Our members are already building initiatives, leading organizations, and driving change in their communities. The council acts as a connector. Between youth and government. Between ideas and implementation. Between rights and reality.

## Our guiding principle

> **Raise your voice for youth rights.**

That’s not a slogan we hang on a wall.  
It’s how we show up in rooms, consultations, and national conversations.
